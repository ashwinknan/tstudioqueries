We have changed the collider to capsule but still the zombie hovering isnâ€™t resolved. Also, we feel that this may have something to do with the zombie shadows-
If you notice there seems to be gap between the zombie model and their shadows giving an effect of them floating.
However, this is only happening in Play mode - as in editor the zombie shadows appear fine exactly below the model. Shadow appears fine for the player model too.

## Expected Answer
They need to set the baseoffset to 0
